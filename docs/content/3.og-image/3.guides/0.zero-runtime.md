title: Zero Runtime
description: Create OG Images without the server runtime overhead.
---

There are cases where we want to deploy our Nuxt app as a server-side app and we want OG Images, but we don't want to host live runtime OG images due to the performance cost.

This performance cost can add up for edge rendering. For a comparison, see the [benchmarks](#benchmarks) below.

To address this, we introduce the `zeroRuntime` config, which ensures all tree-shakable OG image code is removed from the final output.

## Usage

To enable zero runtime, add the following to your config:

```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
export default {
  ogImage: {
    zeroRuntime: true
  }
}
```

## Limitations

When using the Zero Runtime mode none of the community templates will be available in your final build, you must copy+paste any community template that you wish to use into your `components/OgImage` folder.

## Benchmarks

**Nuxt OG Image - Defaults**

Nitro: 1.6mb
- node_modules: 25mb

**Nuxt OG Image - Zero Runtime**

Nitro: 306kb (81% reduction)
- node_modules: 2.0mb (92% reduction)
